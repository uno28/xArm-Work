# xArm-Work
This contains all the work I did for the Music Through Motion semester I did at GT:

It has multiple Max patches which I cycled through before settling on the final patch- which is labeled as Complete9xArms. 
There are multiple Python files which have my code for receiving and sending data over UDP.
There is a Matlab file with all my work on my dance thus far.
I've included a Musescore file which has the musical score for the robots' dance.
There is also a graphic score I used for choreographing the start of my dance.
